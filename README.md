# Newsdesk Wordpress Plugin

A simple plugin for keeping track of articles published on a Wordpress-based site.

### Why Newsdesk?

From experience a Wordpress-based site with a large number of posts can be difficult for users to navigate. Also, in environments where there are lots of editors and sections this is often compunded.

Newsdesk aims to make this a little simpler.

### Features

At this stage Newsdesk does the following:

- List pages and posts recently published in reverse chronological order
- Allows filtering by either "posts" or "pages"
- Lists word counts for posts/pages (in testing)
- List last updated date and time

### To Do

- Possibly rename plugin to "MetaDesk"
- ~~Add word counts to listings~~
- ~~Add "most recent edit" to listings~~
- Filter by different categories
- Fix timezones on published/updated (or disclaim the zone used - currently GMT)
- Format thousands with separator
